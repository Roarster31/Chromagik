# Chromagik
A Chrome extension that reverts Chromatik.com to its previous glory.

The extension takes advantage of Chromatik's free preview by editing the site's cookies so that you can have as many free previews as you want.

For now, the extension is only used by me, and so it always defaults to use the alto saxophone ðŸŽ·

# Usage

To use, just go to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions), enable developer mode and add this unpackaged directory.
